Outline the order of the
content
The social networking website Facebook has become increasingly popular with
over 1.8 billion people using Facebook on a monthly basis (Facebook, 2017). As a
result, there is discussion within the tertiary education sector about the ways in
which websites like Facebook can be used in learning and teaching. Social
networking websites can be defined as online spaces where individuals “present
themselves, articulate their social networks, and establish or maintain connections
with others” (McCarthy, 2012, p. 758). The use of social networking sites within
universities is of interest because of their potential for both positive and negative
impact. Therefore, learners and teachers need to critically evaluate the
educational value of such sites. This essay discusses both the positive and negative
effects of using Facebook at tertiary level. It identifies benefits related to online
community building, engagement and collaboration. It also identifies concerns
about its potential to distract students, and problems of safety and privacy.

One key benefit of using Facebook in teaching and learning isits capacity for online
community building. As Duffy (2011) argues, Facebook can connect students with
peers and teachers, involving them in communities: a vital component of student
success. For example, in Australia and Singapore, first year undergraduate
students participated in virtual discussions, which helped them to connect with
their peers and reduced feelings of loneliness and isolation. In addition, the
students appreciated having time to create and reflect on their responses before
they posted them (McCarthy, 2013). This time to respond may be beneficial for
quieter students, who sometimes avoid vocalising their opinions in a face-to-face
learning environment. When students are seated in large lecture theatres or
classrooms, it may also be difficult for them to get to know one another. Research
shows that socialising and connecting to others is a crucial component of a
satisfying tertiary experience (Elliott & Shin, 2002). Thus, Facebook can provide a
valuable mode of social interaction for students.

Another advantage of Facebook in the tertiary setting is that it can increase
student engagement with course content. Research shows that students who
participate actively in their learning, and in their overall tertiary experience, are
more likely to succeed (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). For example, in one study,
many students were permanently signed into Facebook, so they could frequently
engage with posts related to their course content, assignments and activities (Irwin
et al., 2012). An additional dimension of their participation is that students may
use Facebook comments to critique their experience. For instance, Rambe (2012)
found that students felt empowered to voice concerns about teaching methods,
course materials and institutional processes. They were also relieved to find that
their classmates shared their difficulties. As a result of students’ critique, lecturers
were made aware of issues that affected learning and were able to address these
problems. This type of online interaction demonstrates how Facebook can be used
to access, engage with and critique course content.

A further benefit of Facebook is student collaboration. Students are often required
to do group work or projects where they need to meet outside of class, but it may
be difficult for them to find a suitable time and place to meet. According to
Lankshear and Knobel (2011), online collaboration promotes “innovation and
productiveness”, because people “learn, create and innovate in the company of
others” (p. 215). Additionally, students may feel more at ease when learning in this
“informal and flexible environment” (Mazman & Usluel, 2010, p. 451) because it is
easy for them to exchange information (Sanchez & Javed, 2014). This flexibility
and ease of use means that students are able to contribute to an assignment from
their homes on opposite sides of a city at a time that is convenient and without
the expense of travelling to meet face to face. The ability to work at home may
also decrease the capital expenditure of educational institutions as the need to
provide spaces for group work is reduced. These examples illustrate the potential
for social networking sites to support collaborative learning. However, there are
concerns about Facebook, which need to be considered.

One negative impact of Facebook is its capacity to distract students from their
studies. For instance, Kirschner and Karpinski (2010) question whether students
are able to engage with academic writing or listening while using Facebook at the
same time. Studies have found that students who use Facebook have a lower
Grade Point Average (GPA) and spend less time studying than students who do not
use Facebook (Junco, 2012; Kirschner & Karpinski, 2010). A reduction in the time
spent on activities particularly seems to occur when students are feeling under
time pressure (Janković et al., 2016). Even as little as five to ten hours per week on
social media is likely to have a negative impact on students’ engagement with
assignments (Rouis et al., 2011). These studies all point to a negative relationship
between Facebook use and academic performance.

A second issue with Facebook concerns safety and privacy. Although it is possible for
Facebook users to control access to their own profiles and data, Facebook does not
make this an easy process, and a large proportion of students are unclear about how
to do this effectively (Jordaan & Van Heerden, 2017). Students are then vulnerable to
online predators, who may have access to contact details, personal information, and
photographs. Photographs and videos are a particular concern because of their
potential to cause embarrassment and distress (Kolek & Saunders, 2008). For example,
in New Zealand, photographs of young girls being sexually assaulted when drunk were
posted on a Facebook page causing immense harm to the victims (Quillam, 2013).
Students are also increasingly concerned about the marketing tools being deployed on
Facebook and feel a loss of control over their personal data (Jordaan & Van Heerden,
2017). Therefore, in tertiary teaching and learning contexts, students should be
supported to learn how to protect their profiles and data, and use social networking
sites safely.

State overall position
In summary, this essay has considered the positive and negative aspects of using
Facebook at a tertiary level. Research has identified how Facebook can facilitate social
interaction and rich collaboration between peers. Therefore, it has the potential to
complement face-to-face modes of delivery. However, if Facebook is going to be
effectively and safely used in tertiary teaching and learning, then students and
teachers need careful guidance. Concerns about use centre on the tendency of
Facebook to distract students, as well as the need to support students to better control
privacy settings. In conclusion, although the use of any online tool comes with inherent
challenges that need careful consideration, the benefits exemplify how the integration
of technology offers new approaches to teaching and learning.
