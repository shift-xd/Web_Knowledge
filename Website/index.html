fIRST PROJECT 
    OBJECTIVE

To clearly define and explain the concept of an invertible function, emphasizing that such a function has a unique inverse where each output corresponds to exactly one input.
To explore and understand the mathematical conditions required for a function to be invertible, such as being one-to-one (injective) and satisfying the criteria for the existence of an inverse.
To use graphical methods to visually demonstrate examples of invertible functions including linear functions, exponential functions, and quadratic functions with restricted domains, to better understand their behaviour.

SECTION A
USING A GRAPH TO DEMONSTRATE A FUNCTION WHICH IS INVERTIBLE
(Description continued on next pages about identifying such functions using graphical representations, how to identify inverse functions through the horizontal line test and exploring how the inverse of a function reflects over the line y = x. The project includes simple and well-known examples such as linear functions, exponential functions, and restricted quadratic functions to clearly explain the concept.
Through this visual approach the project helps in building a strong conceptual foundation and appreciation of the elegant symmetry between a function and its inverse.)
DEFINITION OF INVERTIBLE FUNCTION
In mathematics, a function is called invertible if there exists another function that "undoes" the operation of the original function. The inverse function is written as f⁻¹(x).
A function f(x) is invertible if and only if:
f⁻¹(f(x)) = x and f(f⁻¹(x)) = x
for all values of ‘x’ in the domain of the original and inverse functions.
This means that the inverse function essentially reverses the effect of the original function. For instance, if f takes a to b, then f⁻¹ takes b back to a.
HORIZONTAL LINE TEST
The Horizontal Line Test is a visual method to determine whether a function is invertible. A function is invertible only if it is one-to-one – meaning no two inputs give the same output.
How the Test Works:
If every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once, the function is one-to-one and invertible. If any horizontal line cuts it more than once, the function is not invertible unless we restrict its domain.
For example:
f(x) = x + 2 → Passes the test
while f(x) = x² → is a failure.
CONDITIONS FOR INVERTIBLE FUNCTION
Not every function has an inverse. For a function to be invertible, it must satisfy the following conditions:

One-to-One Function (Injective):
A function is one-to-one if different inputs give different outputs. That is, for a function f(x):
If f(a) = f(b), then a = b

If two inputs produce the same output, the function is not one-to-one and cannot have an inverse.
Example:
f(x) = x² is not one-to-one over all real numbers since:
f(2) = 4 and f(-2) = 4.
GRAPHICAL DEMONSTRATION

Linear Functions


This is a straight line with slope 1.
f(x) = x + 2 is one-to-one, and its inverse is f⁻¹(x) = x - 2
The graph of the inverse is also a straight line reflected across the line y = x


Quadratic Function: f(x) = x²


On the full domain, this is not one-to-one
But if we restrict the domain to x ≥ 0, it becomes one-to-one
And its inverse is f⁻¹(x) = √x

CONCLUSION
Through this project, we explored the concept of invertible functions and how their properties can be clearly understood through graphical representation. By using simple and familiar examples like linear, exponential & restricted quadratic functions, we were able to visually identify whether a function is one-to-one and determine the existence of its inverse.
We learned that the horizontal line test is a quick and effective method to check if a function is invertible. If every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once, the function has an inverse, and its graph reflects symmetrically across the line y = x. This symmetry provides deep insight into the relationship between a function and its inverse.

    ## 2ND PROJECT
    INTRODUCTION
In three-dimensional geometry, the shortest distance between a point and a line is a fundamental concept which is typically solved using vector methods. This shortest distance is always measured along the perpendicular from the point to the line. However, there are many practical situations where we need to measure this distance in a specific direction—parallel to a given plane. This introduces an interesting variation to the classical problem, where the measured distance is no longer the absolute shortest but constrained to lie parallel to a reference plane.
The concept of measuring distance parallel to a plane has significant applications across various fields in computer graphics and animation. This principle is used.
STEP 2: Construct Vector from Line to the Point
Next, construct the vector from any point A on the line to the given point P.
\vec{AP} = \vec{P} - \vec{A}
This vector joins the point A on the line to the given point P.
Step 3: Project the Vector onto the Chosen Direction
The required distance is the magnitude of the projection of vector AP onto the direction vector \vec{d}. This is given by:
Distance = \left| (\vec{P} - \vec{A}) \cdot \vec{d} \right| / |\vec{d}|
This gives us the component of AP along the direction of \vec{d}, which is parallel to the plane.

APPLICATIONS
For shadow casting and light projection with sloped surfaces, wind effects on buildings, similar methods are used in ensuring accurate measurements. Operations include orientations, physics applications, analyzing motions along inclined surfaces or calculating wind load on a plane. Relevance in gravity for problem solving in 3D modeling software for precise placement.
Understanding this method enhances our ability to make real-world scenarios where directional constraints are present, illustrating how mathematical concepts can be adapted to solve practical problems with spatial requirements. The vector approach to such problems provides a powerful tool that bridges theoretical geometry with applied sciences and engineering disciplines. This project explores both the mathematical formulation and practicals.
USUAL DISTANCE: PERPENDICULAR FROM A POINT TO A LINE
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
The normal vector to this plane is \vec{n} = (A, B, C).
The shortest distance from a point P to a line L is along the perpendicular dropped from P to L. Using vector algebra, this distance can be calculated by:
Distance = |\vec{b} \times (\vec{P} - \vec{A})| / |\vec{b}|
This formula comes from projecting the vector joining a point A on the line onto a vector perpendicular to the line.
FINDING THE DISTANCE OF A POINT FROM A LINE MEASURED PARALLEL TO A GIVEN PLANE
(Title page.)
WHEN THE DISTANCE IS MEASURED PARALLEL TO GIVEN PLANE
In some applications, we don't want the perpendicular distance, but the distance measured in a direction that is parallel to a given plane. Here's how it's done:
Step 1: Choose the Direction of Measurement
We first choose a direction vector \vec{d} such that:
\vec{d} \cdot \vec{n} = 0
This ensures that \vec{d} lies within the given plane—it is parallel to the plane.
OBJECTIVE

To understand the method of measuring the shortest distance from a point to a line in three-dimensional space, a key concept in vectors geometry.
To explore how this distance changes when measured parallel to a given plane instead of perpendicular—an important variation that introduces geometric constraints.
To apply vector algebra, including direction ratios, cross product, and projection techniques, in solving advanced problems involving lines and planes in space.
To enhance conceptual clarity and spatial understanding through diagrams and step-by-step solutions of representative examples.

UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS
To solve problems involving distances in 3D geometry, it is essential to recall some basic vector concepts:

Point in space: A point P(x, y, z) is represented as a position vector from origin.
Line in vector form: A line can be written as \vec{r} = \vec{a} + \lambda \vec{b}
Where \vec{a} is the position vector of a point on the line, \vec{b} is the direction vector, \lambda is a scalar.
Plane equation: A plane in 3D space is usually given as...

APPLICATION
Distance = |\vec{AP} \cdot \vec{d}| / |\vec{d}|
= |2 \times 2 + 3 \times 1 + 1 \times 0| / \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = 7 / \sqrt{5}

Measuring distances under constraints in CAD and architecture.
In physics, resolving components of displacement parallel to surfaces.
3D modelling for camera angles and lighting projections.

EXAMPLE PROBLEM
Given:

Point P(2, 3, 1)
Line: Passes through A(0, 0, 0) direction \vec{b} = \hat{i} + \hat{j}
Plane: x - 2y + z = 6

Steps:

Find a direction vector \vec{d} lying in the plane (any vector orthogonal to the normal \vec{n} = (1, -2, 1)).
Let's choose \vec{d} = (2, 1, 0), which satisfies \vec{d} \cdot \vec{n} = 0.
Find vector \vec{AP} = (2, 3, 1)
Compute Projection of \vec{AP} on \vec{d}

ANALYSIS & INSIGHT
This concept highlights the flexibility of vector method in solving real-world geometric problems. By altering the direction of measurement—from perpendicular to parallel-to a plane—we uncover how spatial relationships depend on the context.
The project also reveals how vector projections and dot products can adapt basic formulas, making them vital tools in engineering, physics, and computer graphics. Visualizing a line-plane interaction between enriches spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills.
